🏬 Power BI Sales Analytics Project – Electro Hub
📌 Project Overview

In this project, you work as a Data Analyst for a fictional company named Electro Hub.
You are provided with business requirements, and your task is to design the data model and build Power BI reports that meet those requirements.

This project focuses on core Power BI fundamentals that are heavily tested in real-world projects and interviews, including:

Data modeling (Star Schema)

Relationships (Primary Key & Foreign Key)

DAX for complex requirements

Visual interactions and filtering logic

🗄 Data Model & Architecture

Data Model Type: ⭐ Star Schema

Tables Used:

1 Fact Table (Sales)

Multiple Dimension Tables (Products, Customers, Date, Geography, etc.)

Concepts Covered

Primary Key & Foreign Key relationships

Fact-to-dimension relationships

Active vs Inactive relationships

Real-world modeling best practices

📊 Report Pages & Analysis
1️⃣ Top & Bottom Analysis Page

This page focuses on ranking-based analysis, including:

Top 5 Products by Sales

Bottom 5 Products by Sales

Top 5 Products by Quantity

Bottom 5 Products by Quantity

Top & Bottom 5 Products by Profit

These insights are built to directly answer business questions using Power BI visuals and DAX logic.

2️⃣ Sales Performance & Visual Analysis Page

This page includes a variety of visuals to meet different analytical needs:

🗺 Map Visual – Geographic sales distribution

📊 Bar Charts – Category comparisons

📈 Line Charts – Sales trends over time

🎯 Scatter Plot – Relationship between numerical measures

🧾 Card Visuals – Key metrics and KPIs

Focus areas:

Visual selection based on business requirement

Formatting for clarity and readability

3️⃣ Edit Interactions Page

This page demonstrates the Edit Interactions feature in Power BI.

Two different date filters are used on the same page

Left-side filter controls orange visuals

Right-side filter controls pink visuals

Achieved using Edit Interactions

This is a frequently asked interview topic and is covered in detail in this project.

4️⃣ Advanced Filtering Using DAX

An additional page focuses on advanced slicer behavior, where:

Slicers are created using columns from different dimension tables

Dimension slicers are able to filter each other

Achieved without changing relationships

Implemented using DAX measures (e.g., Sales-based logic)

This demonstrates advanced filtering scenarios commonly used in enterprise reports.
