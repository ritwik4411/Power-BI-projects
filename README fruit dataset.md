🍎 Power BI Fruits Sales Analysis Project (Power BI Service)
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build Power BI reports directly in Power BI Service, without starting in Power BI Desktop.

The analysis is based on a Fruits Sales dataset and focuses on:

Report creation in Power BI Service

Using OneDrive as the data source

Connecting live via Power BI Semantic Models

Implementing Snowflake schema

Creating business insights using DAX measures

Sharing reports using multiple enterprise methods

This project highlights that Power BI Service is not only for publishing, but can also be used for report creation and collaboration.

🔗 Data Source

Primary Data Source: OneDrive

Dataset: Fruits Sales Data

Connection Type: Import & Live Connection via Power BI Semantic Models

🧱 Data Model

Schema Type: Snowflake Schema

Demonstrates real-world data modeling concepts

Useful for interview discussions on:
