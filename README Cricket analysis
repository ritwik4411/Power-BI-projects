🏏 Power BI Cricket Analytics Project (ESPN Cricinfo Web Data)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Power BI–based cricket analytics solution built using live web data from ESPN Cricinfo.
The report provides player-level performance insights across Batting, Bowling, and Fielding for India and South Africa.

The key objective of this project is to demonstrate:

Web data extraction (web scraping)

Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query (M language)

Advanced DAX calculations

Interactive, user-driven reporting in Power BI

🌐 Data Source

Source: ESPN Cricinfo (Web)

Data Type: Tabular data extracted directly from multiple web pages

Countries Covered:

🇮🇳 India

🇿🇦 South Africa

Categories:

Batting

Bowling

Fielding

🧩 Project Architecture

The project is divided into three interactive report pages:

1️⃣ Batting Analysis

Player-wise batting performance

Key batting statistics

Ranking and comparative analysis

2️⃣ Bowling Analysis

Player-wise bowling metrics

Performance comparison across formats

Rank-based insights

3️⃣ Fielding Analysis

Fielding contribution of players
