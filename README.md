# Panic Attacks Data Analysis Project (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **panic attacks–related data** to support a **non-governmental organization (NGO)** in designing awareness and outreach campaigns. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to panic attacks and present actionable insights through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.

The project simulates a **real-world data analyst scenario**, covering the complete analytics lifecycle—from data sourcing and transformation to modeling, visualization, and insight generation.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

The NGO aims to:

* Understand patterns and contributing factors behind panic attacks
* Identify trends that can support targeted awareness campaigns
* Enable stakeholders to explore data interactively using filters and visuals

As a **Data Analyst**, the task is to analyze the data and deliver insights in a clear, decision-friendly manner.

## 🗄️ Data Source

* **Database:** Snowflake
* **Access Method:** Power BI Snowflake Connector

The project includes:

* Data understanding and exploration
* Data transformations using both **Snowflake SQL** and **Power Query Editor**

---

## 🔄 Data Cleaning & Transformation

Data preparation was performed using a combination of:

### 1. Snowflake SQL

* Initial data exploration
* Filtering and shaping data at the source level
* Preparing analytical-ready datasets

### 2. Power Query (Power BI)

* Data type corrections
* Column additions for analytical use
* Transformation logic for reporting needs

This hybrid approach ensures performance optimization and clean semantic modeling.

---

## 📐 Data Modeling & DAX

Several **DAX functions** were implemented to support calculations and insights:

* `IF()` – Conditional logic
* `SWITCH()` – Multi-condition evaluation
* `COUNTROWS()` – Record-level analysis
* `FILTER()` – Context-based filtering
* `DIVIDE()` – Safe division for ratios and percentages

Additional calculated columns and measures were created to support visual-level analysis.

---

## 📊 Dashboard & Visualizations

The Power BI report includes multiple pages with interactive visuals such as:

* Clustered column charts
* KPI-level aggregations
* Filter-driven insights

### 🔹 Small Multiples Analysis

One of the key highlights of the project is the use of **Small Multiples**, where:

* Multiple clustered column charts are displayed within a single visual
* Users can easily compare different contributing factors side by side

This enhances analytical depth while maintaining visual clarity.

---

## 🎛️ Interactivity & User Experience

* Slicers and filters allow users to explore factors leading to panic attacks
* Flexible drill-down and comparison across dimensions
* Designed for non-technical stakeholders

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Power BI Desktop**
