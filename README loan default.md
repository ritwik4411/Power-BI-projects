💳 Power BI Loan Default Analysis Project (Dataflows)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end Power BI analytics solution using Power BI Dataflows as the data source and a Loan Default dataset for analysis.

The objective of this project is not only to create an interactive and insightful dashboard, but also to help learners understand enterprise-level BI concepts such as:

Data profiling

Data cleaning and validation

DAX-driven visualizations

Incremental refresh

Report sharing and deployment

🔗 Data Source

Source Type: Power BI Dataflows

Dataset: Loan Default Data

Purpose: Centralized, reusable data preparation for reporting

This project simulates a real-world enterprise BI environment where data is prepared once and reused across multiple reports.
